Slots Accounting System (SAS) Protocol is a standard when comes to Slot Machine and VLTs. And because we were bored and with not enough things to do we decided to build this library

## Scope
This project, once reached a stable release, will be published on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) as a Python package.

# Documentation
Since this library is still under heavy development (but at least is working !) comments are still not complete and there is a draft of documentation into `docs/` folder. 

All the latest documentation regarding this library can be found on [Read The Docs](https://saspy.readthedocs.io/)

In the meantime feel free to checkout the [WiKi of this project](https://github.com/zacharytomlinson/saspy/wiki) where you are gonna find response and solutions to common problems we faced during our journey

# Contribute
